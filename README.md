You need `google-services.json` to make this project work.

## Follow these steps
- Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/

- If you already have a project in firebase you can use it or you can create a new project.
- Once you have your firebase project, make sure you enable **Firestore and Authentication with Email and Password**.
- Once the project is created, select android app as the option to add a new app. You need to fill the package name that is `app.easyinvoice`
- After adding the app you can download the config file that is `google-services.json`.
- Now you can clone this repository and paste the file inside app folder.
- That's it sync your project with gradle files and it should work.
